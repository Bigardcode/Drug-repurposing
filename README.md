# Drug-repurposing


Drug repurposing, also known as drug repositioning, is the process of finding new uses for existing medications that are outside the scope of their original medical indications. There are several compelling reasons for pursuing drug repurposing:

### Reduced Development Time: 
Existing drugs have already undergone extensive testing for safety and efficacy, which can significantly shorten the development timeline compared to developing a new drug from scratch.

### Lower Costs:
The expensive and lengthy process of drug development can be bypassed. This can lead to lower costs in bringing a new treatment to market, as much of the research, development, and regulatory hurdles have already been addressed.

### Known Safety Profiles:  
Since the drugs have already been used in patients, their safety profiles are established. This reduces the risks associated with untested new compounds.

### Potential for Faster Availability:
In cases of urgent medical needs (e.g., emerging infectious diseases), drug repurposing can lead to quicker availability of treatment options.

### Expanding Treatment Options:
It allows doctors to offer new therapeutic options for patients, especially when existing treatments are ineffective or cause significant side effects.

### Identification of New Mechanisms:
Understanding the mechanisms of action of existing drugs can lead to insights that may help in the treatment of other conditions.

### Collaboration Opportunities: 
Drug repurposing can foster collaboration between academia, pharmaceutical companies, and healthcare providers, leading to innovative approaches in treatment.

### Addressing Unmet Medical Needs:
Many diseases have limited treatment options. Repurposing can help find new solutions for these unmet medical needs.

### Leverage Existing Research:
Existing research related to an approved drug can provide valuable information that supports its potential in new therapeutic areas.

### Patient-Centric: 
Successful repurposing can lead to improved patient outcomes by offering treatments that are more tolerable or effective based on the patient's unique conditions or genetics.


 In summary, drug repurposing is a strategic approach that maximizes the use of current resources and knowledge to provide new treatment opportunities, making it a powerful tool in modern medicine.
